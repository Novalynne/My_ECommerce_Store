# My-E-Commerce-Store
This project is for PPM Course.<br>
A complete web application must be developed. Take care
of the dynamic aspect of a website.

The backend must contain at least: <br>
<ul>
<li> 2 different app</li>
<li> 2 relations between model tables</li>
<li> 1 view must use Class-generics</li>
<li> 2 different permission for two groups of users</li>
<li> User class must be extended and customized</li>
</ul>


**E-commerce Store:** Build an ecommerce store with product listings, shopping cart
functionality, and order management. The model complexity can include defining relationships
between products, categories, and user orders. The view logic can involve handling product
searches, adding items to the cart, and processing orders. The template complexity can be
reduced by using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to style the store. Store managers (a
second user group) will be able to manage products, categories, and orders.

## Features
There are two types of users: customers and store managers. 

Customers can register, log in, add products to their cart, and place orders. They can also view their order history, manage their account details and view their favorite products.

Store managers can log in, manage products (add, edit, delete), manage categories, and view all orders placed by customers.

Both users are able to search for products by name or category, and view product details.

## TODO: Add more details about the features and functionalities of the e-commerce store, such as payment methods, shipping options, etc.
